#### Intro
Hello there! I'm Sam - originally from Ireland, but currently living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 
<br><br>
I am the CTO of [ISVWorld](https://isvworld.com) where I work on engineering infrastructure and build tools to do help get better insights from large amounts of data. I mostly work with Python, but try to be hands on with as many technologies as possible. I love learning new things!
<br><br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in education, search engines, crytocurrency/blockchain and machine learning. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to grab a coffee and chat, send me a mail! I am based in Amsterdam.
<br><br>

#### Currently
At ISVWorld I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [isvworld.com](https://isvworld.com)).

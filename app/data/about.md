I'm a seasoned software engineer with a proven track record in leading teams and delivering
high-quality software solutions. My expertise lies in backend development, particularly in Python,
Flask and Django, where I've spearheaded the creation of robust APIs and managed infrastructure on
cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.
